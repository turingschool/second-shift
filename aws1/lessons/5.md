      <p>Open up the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com">AWS Mangement Console</a> and login to your AWS account using the admin user you created in the setup. <b>Do not log into your root account.</b></p>
      <p>At the top of your Management Console next to your username, you'll see "Ohio" listed as your region. Go ahead and change that to US East (N. Virginia).</p>

        <li>This session will touch on the basics of getting up and running with API Gateway. There are so many features of API Gateway, and two hours is only enough time to build out a very basic flow. However, as always, we've included links to additional resources you can use to further your learning once you understand the fundamentals.</li>
        <li>We will not be working with authentication or authorization, API keys, usage plans, HTTPS, or data models, although API Gateway can in fact do all of these things.</li>
        <li>Use the <a target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13O58YyN2vt9V_7kPuNFpR0ic2c2YXxMzXYLIAN_vmao/edit?usp=sharing">Parking Lot</a> to jot down questions you have that are not part of the course.</li>
        <li>Play your part in creating a safe and welcoming learning environment for your classmates.</li>

      <h2 class="section-header">API Gateway Overview</h2>
      <h4>From <a target="blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">AWS:</a></h4>
      <blockquote><small>Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud.</small></blockquote>
      <p><span class="vocab">API Gateway</span> is one of AWS's "serverless" offerings. API Gateway serves as the entry point for a client to connect with, and the backend can be any number of things as shown in <a target="blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">AWS's</a> diagram below:</p>
      <img class="screenshot" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/apigatewaydiagram.png" alt="Diagram of API gateway integration with other services">
      <p>For this session, we'll expose a few endpoints that will send back JSON data to the client. It might look something like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>GET /users</b>: triggers Lambda function allUsers</li>
        <li><b>GET /users/1</b>: triggers Lambda function oneUser</li>
        <li><b>POST /users</b>: triggers Lambda function createUser</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Pricing</h4>
      <p>Under free tier, you're eligible for one million API calls per month. Even after your free tier eligibility expires, API Gateway is very affordable: the first 333,000,000 requests to hit your API will cost you $3.50. The next 667,000,000 will cost $2.80, and the pricing decreases in bulk after that.</p>
      <h4>Serverless Benefits</h4>
      <p>Like Lambda, API Gateway scales without you having to provision resources. By default, REST APIs can handle up to 10,000 simultaneous requests per second, but that limit can be increased with a service ticket.</p>
      <h4>Deployment Stages</h4>
      <p>API Gateway supports the use of "Stages" which can be used for a variety of things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Separating dev/prod endpoints</li>
        <li>Separating v1, v2, v3... etc. of your API</li>
        <li>Canary releases, a process in which a percentage of incoming API traffic is routed to a new production stage in order to test it out</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Data Transformation</h4>
      <p>API Gateway is able to transform data both from the request to the service (like Lambda), or from the service to back out through the Gateway to the client. This is done through Mapping Templates and the use of the Velocity Template Language. There are many uses cases for mapping templates that you can read about <a target="blank" href="https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-override-request-response-parameters.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>API Gateway can also be used to add or change the headers on HTTP responses.</p>
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>Within API Gateway, you can create API keys and use those keys for usage plans. You can also use AWS Cognito for authorization, or you can create your own custom Lambda function for authorizing users.</p>
      <p>API Gateway supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which you can enable by configuring an <code>options</code> method that responds to browser preflight requests. This will allow JavaScript running on other domains to make requests to your API endpoint. In addition, once the actual request is made, you can configure your <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> methods to respond with the correct CORS headers.</p>
      <h4>Structuring API Gateway + Lambda</h4>
      <p>There are multiple ways to connect API Gateway and Lambda:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating one "greedy" endpoint that catches all paths and all methods. This exposes one resource that handles every request, and it's up to the backend code (Lambda, for example), to make decisions about what to do in the cases of path/method combinations.</li>
        <li>Creating separate endpoints that all invoke the same Lambda function. The request would be rejected at the API Gateway level if it doesn't match a specific resource and method combination.</li>
        <li>Creating separate endpoints that each invoke a separate Lambda function. The Lambda function therefore can worry just about code execution and does not have to handle HTTP request parsing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are pros and cons for each approach, and you can read more about different serverless architecture patterns in the additional resources section below. For today, we're going to go with the third option: one Lambda function per resource+method combination.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">API Gateway Hands-On</h2>
      <p>In this section, we'll create an API with a GET and POST endpoint, enable those endpoints support CORS, and deploy our API. <b>Make sure that you are in the N. Virginia region</b> and that you're on the API Gateway dashboard.</p>
      <p>Before we set up an API, let's create three Lambda functions that we can use as our backend: <b>allUsers</b>, <b>oneUser</b>, and <b>createUser</b>.</p>
      <p>This function doesn't need to do anything right now except for return a message saying that we successfully invoked the function.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Workshop: Connecting a Front End to API Gateway and Lambda</h2>
      <p>In this section, build an API Gateway that triggers Lambda functions. You'll then deploy a pre-built front-end on S3 and use it to request data from your API Gateway. Find the workshop instructions <a href="{{site.url}}/aws1/lessons/5_workshop.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Because of the generous free tier limits for API Gateway, S3, and Lambda, you won't be charged for your resources (unless your pet rescue site goes viral). We will be using the petRescue resources in Session 6 when we add our DynamoDB functionality, so <b>don't delete things yet!</b>. If you'd like to delete your user resources, feel free.</p>
