      <ol>
        <li>This course will explore foundational concepts for a variety of AWS services. Because we don't have an unlimited amount of time, we have included links within the curriculum to related concepts beyond the scope of the class.</li>
        <li>Don't be intimidated by the fine-grain control that AWS gives you. When first starting out, stick with the defaults that AWS provides.</li>
        <li>The AWS Ecosystem is vast! It's ok to not know everything.</li>
        <li>Ask questions. If your question refers to something outside the scope of the class, we'll ask you to put the question in the parking lot.</li>
        <li>Play your part in creating a safe and welcoming learning environment for your classmates.</li>
        <li>We will use code in this course, but coding is not the focus of the course. For the code samples we use, we'll do a high-level walk through before integrating AWS services.</li>
        <li>This course is a hands-on approach to learning fundamental AWS services. The content of this course will provide a solid foundation for continuing to pursue either the Cloud Practitioner or Developer Associate <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS Certification Exam</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Theory vs. Hands-On</h4>
      <p>During this course, we'll alternate between discussing theory/facts and actually diving in to see how things work. The theory and facts portions are relevant to the certification exams in addition to having the foundational knowledge to start building using AWS services.</p>

        <h4>From <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/">AWS:</a></h4>
        <p>"Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing."</p>
      </div>
      <p>You can think of this in the same way that you think of any metered bill that you pay (electricity, gas, water, etc.). In this way, an organization does not need to consider time or capacity when scaling their computing needs.</p>
      <p>AWS and other cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. own and service large data centers distributed across the world. In this way, an AWS customer can provision and gain access to resources almost instantly.</p>
      <p>Some of the benefits of AWS Cloud Computing include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster innovation</li>
        <li>Elasticity and scaling</li>
        <li>Lower latency</li>
        <li>Cost savings</li>

      <p>Most of what we'll do in these sessions will involve working through the AWS web console. The web console provides clear context and explanations for the options available on each AWS service, whereas the CLI and SDKs are less transparent and slightly harder to navigate when first learning.</p>

      <h2><a name="Topic1">AWS Free Tier Account</a></h2>
      <p>When you initially sign up for AWS, you will get a free tier account that provides free access to many AWS services. Let's briefly glance at the <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc" title="">free tier limits</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="Topic1">AWS Vocabulary</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Availability Zone:</b> An availability zone is a physical structure containing the computing resources necessary for AWS services. You can picture an availability zone as a warehouse filled with computing resources. Availability zones are designed for high availability and redundancy in order to continue working in the event of a disaster.</li>
        <li><b>Region:</b> A region is a geographical area comprised of three or more availability zones. Within the region, the availability zones are physically separated from each other.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All regions operate fairly similarly; however, you may find some differences in pricing and service availability. In addition, you may choose a specific region for lower latency or regulatory compliance. For our exercises in this class, we'll be using the N. Virgina region (us-east-1) since that's where AWS tends to release most of its features first.</p>
      <p>You can find the current map of regions and availability zones on the <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/" title="">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page.</p>

      <h2><a name="Topic1">IAM: Identity Access Management</a></h2>
      <p>The AWS IAM console gives you a way to manage <b>who</b> or <b>what</b> can use your AWS resources.</p>
      <p><span class="vocab">IAM Users</span> can be used for either people or applications. User accounts can be granted <b>console</b> and/or <b>programmatic</b> access depending on what you'll need the account to do. If granted programmatic access, the account will have access tokens that can be used in code.</p>
      <p>AWS recommends that you <b>do not</b> use the root account for anything and delete the root access keys. In the setup video, you created an admin user. This is what AWS recommends for security purposes.</p>
      <p><span class="vocab">IAM Groups</span> are used to organize user accounts by function. For example, you may create a group called "developers" and grant that group access to EC2, S3 and Elastic Beanstalk. Your "database admin" group might have access to RDS, and your "data science" group would be able to access Redshift and Elastic MapReduce.</p>
      <p>In general, <span class="vocab">IAM Roles</span> are used when you need a specific AWS service to have access to another service. For example, if your Lambda function needs to upload a file to S3, you would assign a role containing those permissions to your Lambda function.</p>
      <p>An <span class="vocab">IAM policy</span> is a document that can be associated with a user, group, or role. IAM policies are written in JSON syntax and define permissions for AWS services.</p> 
      <p>Below is a diagram from the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html" title="">AWS IAM Policy documentation</a> that shows how users, groups, roles, and policies work together:</p>
      <img src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/policies-aws-managed-policies.diagram.png" alt="Users, groups, roles, and policies diagram">
      <h4>Policy Syntax</h4>
      <p>Here's an example of an AWS policy permitting all actions on all S3 resources:</p>
        <pre>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1563910191687",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}</pre>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="vocab">Version</span>: The version of the AWS policy language. The newest version of this language is 2012-10-17.</li>
        <li><span class="vocab">Statement</span>: An array containing groupings for the following elements. A policy can contain more than one statement.</li>
        <li><span class="vocab">Sid</span>: This is an arbitrary name for your statement. You can either choose to keep the pre-generated Statement ID, or you can create your own name.</li>
        <li><span class="vocab">Action</span>: What actions should this user be able to take? Note: * indicates everything.</li>
        <li><span class="vocab">Effect</span>: Are we allowing or denying permissions?</li>
        <li><span class="vocab">Resource</span>: Which AWS service or entity does this apply to? AWS resources will always start with <code>arn:aws:</code> For example, the ARN for an S3 bucket might be <code>arn:aws:s3:::my-first-bucket</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's look at one more example:</p>
<pre>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1563911150715",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-first-bucket"
    }
  ]
}</pre>
      <p>AWS provides pre-defined policies for common use cases called AWS managed policies. We will be using AWS managed policies during this course.</p>
      <p>You can also create your own policy documents using the <a target="blank" href="https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html" title="">Policy Generator</a>. These are called customer managed policies.</p>
      <div class="try-it">
        <h4>Try It: IAM Policies</h4>
        <p>Open the two example policy links below. With a partner, discuss: If we were to assign these policies to users, what would they be able to do?</p>

      <h2><a name="Topic1">S3 Overview</a></h2>
      <p>Released in 2006, AWS Simple Storage Service, or S3, provides object-based cloud storage with virtually no capacity limit.</p>
      <h4>Storage Classes and Pricing</h4>
      <p>AWS S3 offers multiple types of storage, called <span class="vocab">storage classes</span>. These storage classes differ in terms of pricing, latency, availability, and durability.</p>
      <div class="try-it">
        <h4>Try It: Storage Classes</h4>
        <p>Open the <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/" title="">S3 Storage Classes</a> documentation from AWS.</p> 
        <p>With a partner, discuss: What are the main differences between Standard, Standard One Zone Infrequent Access, and Glacier? Use both the individual descriptions and the performance chart near the bottom.</p>
        <p>Done? Look at the specifications for remaining three storage classes.</p>
      </div>
      <p><a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" title="">Pricing</a> for S3 is based on both storage and bandwidth (data transfer). AWS provides a <a target="blank" href="https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" title="">calculator</a> for estimating your total monthly cost based on parameters you enter.</p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <p>S3 is organized using <span class="vocab">buckets</span> (think of these like folders) and <span class="vocab">objects</span> (files and their related metadata). An account is limited to 100 buckets by default, but you may request more through Amazon. Individual objects within the buckets can be between 1 byte to 5 terabytes.</p>
      <p>Bucket names must be unique across <b>all</b> buckets in the S3 namespace and can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.</p>
      <p>Buckets can contain folders, but it's important to remember that a folder is just part of an object key name.</p>
      <h4>Consistency Models</h4>
      <p>A consistency model explains what data will</p>

- consistency models
- read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- eventually consistent for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects for a short time
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>S3 supports SSL/TLS so that your data is protectd <b>in transit</b>. By default, data stored in S3 is not encrypted <b>at rest</b>; however, you can choose to encrypt your S3 objects either client-side (encrypted before you send) or server-side (encrypted by AWS while stored).</p>
      <p>Block public access</p>
      <p>Bucket policies</p>
      <h4>Integration with other AWS Services</h4>
      <p>S3 can be used in conjunction with many other AWS services (for example: Athena, Lambda, CloudWatch logs, CloudFront, etc).</p>
      <div class="together">
        <h4>Together: S3 Buckets and Objects</h4>

      <h2><a name="Topic1">Static Sites on S3</a></h2>
      <p>S3 is a great tool for hosting static sites (including front-end only projects). In this section, we'll deploy a very simple website with an html file, css file, js file, and an image.</p>
      <p>For this section, you'll need to download the <a href="https://secondshiftexample.s3.amazonaws.com/secondshiftexample.zip" title="">project files</a>.</p>

      <p>For these exercises, we'll create a new IAM user with <b>S3 permissions only</b>. Make note of the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, as you'll need to reference them in your code.</p>
