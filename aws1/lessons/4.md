      <p>Open up the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com">AWS Mangement Console</a> and login to your AWS account using the admin user you created in the setup. <b>Do not log into your root account.</b></p>
      <p>At the top of your Management Console next to your username, you'll see "Ohio" listed as your region. Go ahead and change that to US East (N. Virginia).</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">What is "Serverless"?</h2>
      <h4>From <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">AWS:</a></h4>
      <blockquote><small>Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that enables you to shift more of your operational responsibilities to AWS, increasing your agility and innovation. Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning.</small></blockquote>
      <p>The name "serverless" is misleading. Indeed, <span class="vocab">serverless</span> computing does use servers. It's just that <b>you</b> don't need to acquire, provision, or maintain those servers.</p>
      <p>Initially, the word "serverless" referred to AWS Lambda. In the past few years, "serverless" has come to encompass multiple AWS services, including S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Elastic File System, and more. These services allow the user to focus on building with the tools instead of managing and operating servers.</p>
      <p>The diagram below <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/build-a-web-app/">from AWS</a> shows a basic flow for a serverless web application:</p>
      <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/serverless.png" alt="AWS serverless diagram">
      <p>Today, we won't be building out a full web application. Instead, we will be setting up an S3 trigger which invoke our Lambda function. It will look more like <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">this diagram from AWS</a>:</p>

      <a name="lambda"></a>
      <img class="section-image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/lambda.png" alt="AWS Lambda icon">
      <h2 class="section-header">Lambda Overview</h2>
      <p><span class="vocab">Lambda</span> is a service that allows you to write functions that are hosted by AWS. There are no servers involved. A Lambda function only runs when it is invoked, and your account is only charged for the time that the Lambda function is executing.</p>
      <p>Compare this to a web application hosted on an EC2 instance. When we provision that instance, we pay for every hour that it runs, even if nobody uses it. In addition, if we are suddenly inundated traffic, one of two things will happen: either our EC2 instance will not be able to handle the traffic (since your hardware is limited), or our ASG will add EC2 instances which will end up costing more money.</p> 
      <p>With Lambda, you pay only for the amount of time your function executes. Additionally, Lambda can scale infinitely. Each trigger will invoke another separate call of the Lambda function. Under free tier usage, <b>you get 1 million Lambda requests</b> and <b>400,000GB of compute time</b>.</p>
      <h4>Languages</h4>
      <p>Lambda supports several runtimes, including:</p>
      <img style="width: 20%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/lambdaruntimes.png">
      <p>When you're building out your Lambda function, it's important to use the <b>same version</b> of the language that Lambda supports. Otherwise, your function will not run on Lambda.</p>
      <h4>IAM Roles</h4>
      <p>If your Lambda function is integrated with other AWS services, such as S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, etc., you will need to grant Lambda an <span class="vocab">IAM role</span> with policies that grant permission to use those resources. You can think of an IAM role in a similar way to an IAM user, except that a role is generally used to grant one AWS service permission to access another service, rather than granting a human or an app permission. </p>
      <p>Every Lambda function will have a role, with the most basic version being the ability to post logs to CloudWatch. It is best practice to give every Lambda function <b>its own role</b>. In production code, don't share the same role between functions. Let's look at an <a target="blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-create-an-aws-iam-policy-to-grant-aws-lambda-access-to-an-amazon-dynamodb-table/">AWS diagram</a> showing how Lambda could a role to access other AWS services:</p>
      <img src="{{site.urp}}/assets/images/lambdaiam.png" alt="Lambda role diagram">
      <p>Lambda can be used through the AWS console, the AWS CLI, SDKs, the Serverless framework, or AWS SAM CLI. In this course, we'll be using both the AWS console and the AWS CLI.</p>

      <p>In this section, you'll build out a function that is triggered when you upload an object to an S3 bucket. That function will take the image, turn it into a grayscale version, and re-upload it into a separate S3 bucket.</p>
