# Rainbow room

This is a room where the color changes every time you click an element.

## Iteration 1

Create an empty HTML document with `html`, `head`, and `body` tags and add a background color to the page.

## Iteration 2

Add an event listener so that when you click on the page, the background color changes.

## Iteration 3

Create square that roughly takes up 1/4 of the page. Set that square's background color to something different than the main page.

## Iteration 4

When you click the square you just added, its background color should change.

## Iteration 5

Add three more squares to the page that have the same functionality as the first square

## Iteration 6

When any of the squares have the same background color, print the string "It's a match!" to the screen for 5 seconds.
