* assign values to variables using proper naming conventions


### Strings

What is a string?

They're used to store collections of letters and numbers.  It could be a single
letter like "a", a word like "hi" or an entire sentence like "I like pie."

A Ruby string is defined by a quote (") followed by zero or more letters,
numbers or symbols, and followed by a closing quote of the same type ("). You
can use single quotes or double quotes so long as they match.

It is important to note that strings can also be really long! They can also
contain a paragraph or more of text!


```Ruby
"here is a string"
"1234567"
"***** THIS IS ANOTHER STRING YAY *****"

#### Practice

Which of the following are valid strings? Why?

''
"123"
123
"@*#%&"
hello, world!
'welcome to Turing'
'987654321."
"hot chocolate is the best"

#### Our First Program

Let's write a program where we print out strings. First, we’ll need to make a
file and save it as `strings.rb`.

```ruby
print "here is a string"
print "1234567"
print "**** this is another strong ****"
```

Now, to run this program, type `ruby strings.rb` from the command line.

Using `print` does not add a line between each string. If we want to do that,
we can use `puts`.

```ruby
print "here is a string"
print "1234567"
print "**** this is another string ****"
```

#### Try It: Printing Strings

Write a program that prints out your name, location and email address, each
separated by a line of dashes.

#### Substrings

Try it, type the following examples in, and determine what they do.

```ruby
"hello, world"[0]
"Turing"[0..1]
"ruby"[2]
"lunch"[-1]
```

We can pull out specific parts of a string. For example, I may want to know only
the first letter of a string. In programming, we start with the position 0 and
count up from there.

I can access the first letter of a string using this notation:

`"hello, world"[0]`

Here, we will get back the letter "h".

Try the following and determine what they do:

```ruby
"hello, world"[0..4]
"Turing"[0..1]
"ruby"[1..-1]
"lunch"[0..-2]
```

We use this notation to pull out substrings. For example, I may want to get back
the substring "hello" from "hello, world". To do that, I can use this notation:

`"hello, world"[0..4]`

In Ruby, `..` indicates an inclusive range. The above example means give me back
all of the characters at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Ruby interprets negative positions to count back from the end of the string. So
in "Hi", the "i" is in position -1 and the "H" is in position -2.

So if a letter has both a positive and negative position number, which should
you use? If you can use the positive numbers do it, they’re easier to reason
about. But, if you’re looking for something based on it being at the end of the
string (like "What’s the last character of this string?"), then use the negative
positions.


### Introduction to String Methods

A `method` in Ruby can be thought of as a message that's being sent to an
object. The message is received, and something is returned where it was called.
Here's a simple example:

```ruby
"hello, world".upcase
```

The method is `.upcase`, the object it's being called on is "hello, world", and
the return value is "HELLO, WORLD". Like the above example, most methods you'll
see use what we call "dot notation" where there is a dot between the object and
the method.

Let's open up some Ruby documentation:
[String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/String.html). Take a look on the
left-hand side underneath "Methods". We'll walk through the two below to start:

```
capitalize
center
```

You can think of a method as a command. With a dog, a command you might give
is "bark". In code, we represent it as:

`dog.bark`

This is called “dot notation” and the terminology is “call the bark method on dog”.

Strings also have methods. Here are some common ones:

```ruby
message = "Hello, World!"

puts message.capitalize
puts message.upcase
puts message.downcase
puts message.include?("World")
puts message.include?("Mars")
puts message.reverse
puts message.length
```
#### String Concatenation

In order to talk about string concatenation, we'll first talk a little about
variables. Programming is all about creating abstractions, and in order to
create an abstraction we must be able to assign names to things. Variables are
a way of creating a name for a piece of data.

First, we'll assign the string "mary" to the variable `student`:

```ruby
student = "Mary"
```

Let's say that we want to create a string that says "Welcome to class, Mary."
There are two ways to do this. We'll start with concatenation first, which joins
strings together with the plus sign:

```ruby
"Welcome to class, " + student + "."
```

Try it out.

*Try it*: Create two more of your own examples of string concatenation using a
variable.

Note that the `+` is also a string method. It does not use dot notation.

#### String Interpolation

The second approach is to use string interpolation where we stick data into the
middle of a string.

String interpolation only works on a double-quoted string. Within the string we
use the interpolation marker #{}. Inside those brackets we can put any variables
or Ruby code which will be evaluated, converted to a string, and output in that
spot of the outer string. Our previous example could be rewritten like this:

```ruby
"Welcome to class, #{student}."
```

If you compare the output you’ll see that they give the exact same results. The
interpolation style tends to be fewer characters to type and fewer open/close
quotes and plus signs to forget. String interpolation is preferred and more
common. You should take note of the fact that string interpolation **will only
work inside of double-quoted strings**. This would not work:
`'Welcome to class, #{student}.'`

*Try it*: Create two more examples of your own using string interpolation and a \
variable.

#### Variables

Now that we've talked about basic variable assignment, let's get into some of
the more detailed rules.

In some languages you need to specify what type of data (like a number, word,
etc) can go in a certain variable. Ruby, however, has a flexible type system
where any variable can hold any kind of data. Additionally, some languages
require you to "declare" a variable before you assign a value to it. Ruby
variables are automatically created when you assign a value to them. Let’s try
an example:

```ruby
x = 10
x
```

The line `x = 10` creates the variable named a and stores the value 10 into it.

In English we read left-to-right, so it’s natural to read code left to right.
But when evaluating an assignment using the single equals (=), Ruby actually
evaluates the right side first. Take the following example:

```ruby
b = 10 + 5
```

The 10 + 5 is evaluated first, and the result is given the name b.

*Try it*: What is c at the end of this? Why?

```ruby
c = 15
c = "hello"
c
```

### Naming Variables

Most Ruby variables (local variables) have a few requirements. They...

* always start with a lowercase letter (underscore is permitted, though uncommon)
* have no spaces
* do not contain most special characters like $, @, and &

In addition to those requirements, Rubyists have a few common style preferences
for variable names:

* use snake case where each word in the name is lowercase and connected by
underscores (_)
* are named after the meaning of their contents, not the type of their contents
* aren’t abbreviated

Good variable names might be count, students_in_class, or first_lesson.

A few examples of bad Ruby variable names include:

* `studentsInClass` – uses camel-case rather than snake-case, should be
students_in_class
* `1st_lesson` – variables can’t start with a number, should just be
first_lesson
* `student_name_string` – includes the type of the data in the name, should just
be students
* `msg` – abbreviates rather than just using message

*Try it:* Use IRB to store values with each of the following variable names.
Which names are good, which are actually invalid Ruby, and which are valid but
go against Ruby style?

* `time_machine`
* `student_count_integer`
* `homeworkAssignment`
* `3_sections`
* `top_ppl`

## Integers

Numeric data comes in two types: Integers and Floats. Integers are whole numbers
(no decimals) and are either of the class Fixnum or Bignum. Floats are numbers
that have decimal places.

```ruby
123456789.class
1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000.class
5.6.class
1.239.class
```

*Try it*: Predict the return value before trying these in IRB. Which of these
work? Which of these do something you didn't expect?

```ruby
3 + 4
2 * 4
2 ** 5
6 - 2
4 / 2
3 / 4
3.0 / 4.0
3 / 4.0
3.0 / 4
1.5.to_s
5.5.to_i
1 + "2"
1 + "2".to_i
(1 + 2) * 3
1 + (2 * 3)
```

We can also (somewhat) combine strings and integers. Try these:

```ruby
"hi" * 5
5 * "hi"
```

### Introducing Number Methods

All of the arithmetic operations that you tried above are actually methods.
Let's look at the documentation for
[Integer](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Integer.html#method-i-gcd) and
[Float](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Float.html).

```
round
to_f
to_i
to_s
floor
ceil
abs
%
==
>
>=
even?
odd?
next
```

Spicier methods:

```
upto
times
```
