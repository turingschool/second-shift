### Mario

Your job will be to write a program, using loops and conditionals and other methods, in order to recreate the half pyramid
that Mario has to jump over at the end of Super Mario Brothers.

Given a number, you will construct a half pyramid, and print it out to the screen. Below we have an example where we are
generating a pyramid with a number of three - note that the base is 3 pound symbols wide and 3 high.

```

Below here, we have a pyramid set to five.


```

  ###
 ####
#####
```


Bonus: Include the flag after the pyramid like so:

```     *
    #   |>
   ##   |
  ###   |
 ####   |
#####   |
```



Super Bonus: Do all of the above, and make it so that the pyramid height is based on user input.
