## Class details, working agreements, and class goals

* 12 total classes Ã  3 hours each
* Homework and projects are not mandatory but strongly encouraged
* There is no pass/fail for this course, but will be able to try into Turing Front End module 1 at the end of it

Every class will have a warmup, 10-20 minutes in the beginning of the class where we solve some kind of logic problem or code challenge in pairs.

Retro and Gear Up are things Turing students do every Friday and are also big parts of Turing's mission. We will do a Gear Up session in the middle of the course and a retro at the end.
