title: Second Shift Curriculum
---

The content on this site is part of Turing's Second Shift program. Each course is designed to last six weeks with two sessions each week. We also have a full-time program for both front end and back end engineering. For more information on those programs and our mission, please visit our [main site](https://www.turing.io/)

Most of the resources here are geared toward our students but the curriculum is available for anyone to view and learn from.
