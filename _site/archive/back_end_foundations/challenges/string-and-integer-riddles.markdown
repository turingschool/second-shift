## String and Integer Riddles

### Strings

* How can I tell how many characters are in a string? Do spaces count?

* How can I capitalize the first character of a string? What
happens if it is a number?

* How can I turn a string backwards?

* How can I tell if two words have the same number of characters?

* How can I tell if a word has all capital letters?

* How can I tell if a word has all lower case letters?

* How can I tell if a word is a palindrome? (The word is the same forwards and
  backwards.)

* How can I tell if a sentence is the same forwards and backwards? (ignoring spaces and punctuation)

* How can I replace an occurrence of a single character in a string with another
character?

* How can I replace ALL occurrences of a single character in a string with
another character?

* How do I insert 5 asterisks at the start of a string? What about at the end of
a string? What about x asterisks?

* What if I wanted to have a string that's four characters long, but I want to
make a big string thats 14 characters in length, with the original string in the
middle, with asterisks on either side of the original string to make it reach
the desired length?

* What if I wanted to replace the padding character with spaces? And a variable
total length?

* What are two ways in which you can determine if an integer is odd? (Or even.)

* How can I convert a string into a number?

* How can you tell if a number is a palindrome? (303, 1221, 123321)

* How can you tell if a number is divisible by 3? By 9? By x?
