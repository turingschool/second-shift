<h2 id="mission-alignment">Mission Alignment</h2>

<p><em>Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.</em></p>

<p>Most students at Turing seem to share a high level of grit, defined as “perseverance and passion for long-term goals.” Grit helps students consistently engage and reengage learning opportunities and challenges that are often difficult and frustrating. When we envision the challenges students will face in the field (tackling new problems, mastering new material), grit also appears to be a mindset that students need to succeed after they graduate.</p>

<p>For that reason, we’ve included grit as a key mindset for students at Turing, and our curriculum is designed to help students cultivate this attitude. However, while we can encourage students to develop passion and practice sticking with difficult material, deep grit depends on students’ ownership of their struggle and their ability to adjust their attitude and remind themselves of their passions and motivations when they feel discouraged.</p>

<p>Today’s exercise is designed to develop students’ awareness of grit and relate it to their personal lives. If grit is not a relevant concept for you, you will want to use this session to clarify why it is not, and reflect on how you will need to manage your attitude in the face of Turing’s formidable challenges.</p>

<h2 id="goals-of-session">Goals of Session</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Students will be able to define grit and articulate the role that passion plays in sustaining grit</li>
  <li>Students will be able to articulate how grit is a function of behaviors and attitudes, not a fixed quality</li>
  <li>Students will be able to apply the concept of grit to module-specific professional challenges they’ll face in the coming inning or in their job search.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="watch-7-min">Watch (7 min)</h2>
<p>Together, we will watch grit researcher Angela Duckworth’s TEDTalk, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance#t-85401">“Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.”</a></p>

<h2 id="read-13-min">Read (13 min)</h2>
<p>Independently, we will read these articles.</p>

<h2 id="write-10-min">Write (10 min)</h2>
<p>Reflect independently in your notebook on these questions.</p>

<h3 id="everyone">Everyone</h3>
<p>Think of a time when you’ve been tempted to give up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?</li>
  <li>Is that lens helpful?</li>
  <li>Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="module-1">Module 1</h3>
<p>Growth mindset is a necessary for grit.  Both growth mindset and the concept of grit speak to one’s ability to deal with the ego-stripping experience of failure and challenge that accompany learning and growth.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How would you define the distinction between these two?</li>
  <li>How can they work together?</li>
  <li>How has your growth mindset impacted your grit in Module 1?
    <h2 id="group-work">Group Work</h2>
    <p>Before you begin discussing this topic, count off into groups of three. Ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Timekeeper</strong></td>
      <td>Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Facilitator</strong></td>
      <td>Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Spokesperson</strong></td>
      <td>Keeps track of the topics discussed, and is prepared to represent the group when it’s time for each group to report out the highlights of their conversation.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="discussion-15-min">Discussion (15 min)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Begin by sharing your current definition or exposure to grit.
    <ul>
      <li>“I’ve read a lot about grit, particularly about how it can be really dangerous when applied in an educational context. It can be used to put pressure on students to suck it up and get through the work, instead of equipping them to tackle the sources of some of their difficulties”</li>
      <li>“My dad always uses grit as a way to complement someone. It means being tough, sucking it up, not whining.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Facilitator move your group into answering your module specific questions.  Be sure that everyone has an opportunity to share.</li>
  <li>Timekeeper: Announce when you have 2 minutes left in your discussion.  Facilitator:  Help your group come up with the 1-2 ideas you want to share whole group or a summary of what your group discussed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="groups-report-out-10-min">Groups Report Out (10 min)</h3>
<p>Spokesperson from each group will report out the top 1-2 reflections that came from their writing and discussion.</p>
