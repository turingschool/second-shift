### Discussion (30 min)
Discuss the question “How are institutions shaped by individual actions?” through the lens of ageism in the tech industry. 
* According to the articles and your own experiences, what institutional norms and practices perpetuate ageism?  
* Identify three scenarios in which you are likely to encounter these institutional norms and practices in your first 3 years of employment in the tech industry?  
* How do you expect you will you be affected by these norms and practices? Will you benefit or suffer from them?  
* Pick the scenario that’s most interesting to your group. Brainstorm three ways of responding to the situation. Then answer the question for each: if everyone in your position responded to this situation the same way, what impact would that have on the tech industry as a whole?  
* What type of action in this situation is most consistent with your values and feels authentic?
